SublimeLinter-coffeelint 1.0.3
-------------------------------
The linter plugin will search for coffeelint.json in the
edited file's directory and continue until it reaches the
root directory. If it finds a coffeelint.json,
'-f /path/to/coffeelint.json' is passed to coffeelint.

Unfortunately there is no sane way to support a
coffeelintConfig object within a package.json file,
the way coffeelint itself does.
